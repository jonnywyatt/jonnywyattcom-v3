          <p><strong>I have a very strong track record of rapidly delivering quality
            software.</strong></p>
          <p>The core of my skillset is front end and I’ve added over 2 years’ solid experience in
            Node.js and React. I have a good handle on the array of developments in the Javascript
            space, plus the experience to know which of them to benefit from. I’m passionate about
            web performance and know how to measure and achieve it.</p>
          <p>I understand every angle of a successful agile team including cross-disciplinary
            collaboration, user-centred testing and design, lean UX, early & continuous delivery,
            TDD, test automation, pairing and how to funnel business requirements through user
            stories.</p>
